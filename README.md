# wordpuzzle

A word puzzle is a word game that consists of the letters of words placed in a grid, which usually has a rectangular or square shape.

The words may be placed horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

Often a list of the hidden words is provided, but more challenging puzzles may let the player figure them out.
